# Web-Scraping-Mission-To-Mars

During this project, I used concepts that I have learned to web-scrape and do data analysis for a mission to Mars. After learning how to identify HTML elements on a page, identifying their id and class attributes, I used this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. First, for Deliverable 1, I scraped titles and preview text from Mars news articles. Then, for Deliverable 2, I scraped and analyzed Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

# Data

This folder contains mars_data.csv, the DataFrame that I exported to a CSV file after Scraping and Analyzing Mars Weather Data.
